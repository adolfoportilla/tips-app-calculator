## Notes

When I started the assignment I had difficulties with the instructions, for some reason the instructions were not updated and I could not made any progress with the settings section. After the instructions were updated I started making progress with it. 
I also had problems with the design of the main screen.
The language is also complicated since you need to link the code with the different graphic items. I struggle at the begging because I did not linked them.
